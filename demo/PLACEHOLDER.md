# How to Add Your Demo Video

To add your demo video to this repository:

1. Place your .mp4 file in this directory (`demo/`)
2. Rename it to `demo.mp4`
3. Commit and push the file:
   ```bash
   git add demo/demo.mp4
   git commit -m "Add demo video"
   git push
   ```

The video should be an .mp4 file showcasing the GiftFlow application features and functionality.

**Note**: GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB. If your video is larger, consider:
- Compressing the video using tools like HandBrake or FFmpeg
- Hosting it on YouTube, Vimeo, or another video platform and linking to it instead
- Using GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS) for large files

Once added, the demo video will be accessible via the link in the main README.md file.
